        <h2>Splitting the Bill</h2>

Split is here to help you keep track of who owes you money for that last trip to that new Tapas bar or French tasting menu restaraunt.

          <p>The modern dilemma: too many friends and too many group outings. You're out with a group and they want to split the bill equally. Many restaurants will charge you extra for splitting with more than two credit cards. Sometimes, you might get the stinkeye from the waiter who will complain it was not part of his or her role to know how to calculate the math on splitting bills among "X" amount of friends. If a restaurant has a max amount of times a bill can be split, more ofthen than not, one friend will end up paying the bill and asking everyone to just pay them back, but what happens when you have that one shady friend who will try to reason that he or she had already paid you back?</p>
          <br>
          <p>SPLIT is here to help you solve your problems and prevent any possible friendship rifts that might come across just because Millenials are that forgetful. When the one person who pays the bill logs in to the app. you will be prompted to add the friends who were at the meal into the bill. The local restaurants that are working with SPLIT will have electronically sent the payee the bill already and our app will calculate the split bill evenly for all members of the party. The friends will be notified immedaitely to 'OK' this transaction and money will be pulled out of their bank accounts directly to be sent to the friend who had paid. There will be daily reminders to those who have yet to pay back their friends to ensure that money is sent in a prompt manner, preventing any awkward interactions for any future group hangouts.</p>
