        <h2>Splitting the Bill</h2>
        <p>Figuring out how to split the bill has never been easier. Split is here to help you keep track of who owes you money for that last trip to that new Tapas bar or French tasting menu restaraunt. A one-stop app that allows you to charge your friends an even split of the bill. We have partnered with many local restaurants in major metropolises around the US. We have launched in Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and New York so far.</p>

    <!-- When we get together with friends at a restaurant, it's nice to be able to make things easier on the server not split the bill.  This app allows you to pay the bill then send an amount due to your friends.
    MVP
    - Onboarding process for users
    - Ability for an Organizer to invite other users (via username, email, phone, etc) to the "table" to split the bill with.
    - The organizer enters the total amount due and it's split evenly across everyone at the table
    - When the friend pays their part to the payor, the payor can mark it as paid and it's reflected on both of their profiles
    STRETCH
    - The organizer can enter a specific amount due for each of thier friends, but the app will alert them of they are asking for more than the total amount due.
    - Create a way to send an invite email or text to friends at the table that are not yet signed up for the app. -->

      <h3>Why SPLIT?</h3>
    
      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>
